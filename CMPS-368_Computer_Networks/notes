networks are meant to share INFORMATION and RESOURCES



Types of networks:
	1. LAN (Local Area Network)
		- limited to specific area (like an office or a building)
		- logical workgroups
		- are permanent connections
		- are PRIVATE network connections
		- older LANs use half duplex while newer LANs use full duplex
			- half duplex is one directional communication
				- like walkie talkies where when you press to talk, you can't hear the other person

	2. WAN (Wide Area Network)
		- crosses metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries
			- might connect a block together, a whole city together, or just two building across the street from each other
			- ceases to be a private network (LAN) and the physical wires are owned (or bought by) a third party
			- ex: the internet
		- uses routers and public network links
		- covers greater distances than a LAN
		- usually slower than LANs
		- WAN connections may be temporary
			- ex: may only be on between 8 and 10 am
		- can be full or half duplex
		- centralized or distributed (internet)



P2P (Peer to Peer)
	- no centralized control over network
	- all computers are equal
	- access rights controlled by the computer with the data or resource
		- comp A controls the access rights to its data while comp B might have its own access rights to its own data
	- limits the number of computers (usually around 10)
		- whenever a computer "talks" to another on a network, it really sends that message to all computers on that network
		  because there doesn't exist a machine to organize everything



client/server
	- manages an entire newtork from one point
	- clients make request to servers and the server responds to that request
	- opposite of P2P
	- is more organized than P2P
	- has better security than P2P





Primary Network Components
	- workstation
		- a computer used by an individual to do work
			- work like word processing, drafting, graphics
		- an operating system on a workstation is an interpreter to send messages to a service
	- client
		- anything that requests resources from a network
		- a workstation can be a client
		- a printer is a client, but not a workstation
	- host
		- used mostly when talking about network protocol TCP/IP software related functions
		- a host is any network with TCP/IP
	- server
		- provides resources to the clients on the network
		- dedicated computers that provide a service to the network
		- a SERVER provides a SERVICE
		- almost always have a backup hardware (two PSUs, two MOBOs, etc) and software
		- has A LOT of physical resources (storage, memory, etc)
		- has to remain cool





Network Attached Storage (NAS)
	- replaces file servers
	- easy to setup
	- uses a proprietary OS
	- can use proprietary disk file system which can make it more secure
	- can serve as a DHCP server



Network Topology
	- tells us the way that cables and other pieces of hardware connect to one another

	1. physical topology
		- refers to how cables and devices are physically connected in the real world
	2. logical topology
		- an abstract schematic of how devices are connected


Types of Topologies
	1. BUS topology
		- connects each computer in a daisy chain
		- passive (no powered devices are needed to connect computers)
		- half duplex environment (one host talks at a time)
		- uses a terminator cable
		- uses a ethernet topology 10Base2 (10 megabits / base band technology / 185 meters max)
		* advantages
			- is super simple and uses the least amount of cable and money
			- a repeater can extend distance
		* disadvantages
			- heavey use slows down the network (bandwidth)
			- each connection lowers the signal
			- host moves or changes are hard (when one computer is disconnected, the network goes down)
			- low fault tolerance (if one cable dies, the whole network dies)
	2. ring topology
		- a BUS that connects in a circle (the end is connected to the start)
	3. star topology
		- the VAST majority of computer networks are star topologies
		- each host is conneected separately to a hub
		- has a central connection (hub) for all computers
		- high fault tolerance (if one computer breaks, then nothing else is affected)
		* advantages
			- hosts can be added easily
			- high fault tolerance
			- if one cable failes, one host fails
		* disadvantages
			- higher costs (needs more cables and needs hubs)
			- hub failure (if the hub dies, the whole network dies)
	4. star-ring topology
		- when the hub in a star topology uses an internal ring topology
		- so the hub itself is a ring, but the whole network connects to the hub in a star
	5. star-bus topology
		- same thinking with star-ring but with bus



Mesh & Point-to-Multipoint
	- connection from one computer to EVERY other computer on the network
		- one computer must have a connection to each individual computer on the network
	- extremely populare with wireless connections rather than physical connections
	* advantage
		- redundancies (even with multiple wire failures, we can still talk to each computer)



Point-to-Point
	- two computers connect directly
	- no need for a central hub
	- can be wired or wireless


Wireless
	- two modes of operaton
		- ad hoc (point-to-point)
		- multipoint
