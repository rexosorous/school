when was it introduced? ie. is it old tech? new tech?
what is it's expected lifespan? is it going to last you a while, or are you going to have to replace it soon?
focus should be on the product, not the company
does the product do what it's supposed to?
	- the company may say it does x, y, z with n performance, but does it actually do that?
the final conclusion should be, is it a good or bad choice?
